description: building a self-sustaining, digital, real-time bus stop information sign

This project was part of our Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering (ECE) senior design project, where two other students and myself built a self-sustainable digital bus information display on a standalone structure. It is powered by a battery which is recharged by a solar panel mounted on top of the structure. It provides real time bus information through an integrated wifi module, and displays two sets of information: first, the estimated time of arrival for the various bus routes on a LED matrix, and secondly, the location the buses on campus displayed on a map backlit by a LED strip.

The picture above on the left shows a charge controller we tested out, which we later redesigned and integrated into the PCB. We used a lightweight 50-Watt solar panel to charge the battery which in turn powers the LEDs. It was quite a success that we managed to get the approval of the school's administration to carry out a trial by installing it at one of the campus bus stops (below left), where it was self sustaining for half of the semester.
