Physao is a student startup founded by four recent graduates of Duke University. Physao has created an accurate low cost digital spirometer for asthmatic and 
other chronic obstructive pulmonary desease (COPD) sufferers. The device is able to connect to mobile devices, and therefore the internet, making medical data significantly more accesible for both doctors and patients.

I am working on several aspects in this group, include the software development of the mobile application, the firmware and hardware of the spirometer device, and exploring the data analytics of medical data.
