The Software Design and Implementation course at Duke University involves a half semester long project in groups of 10 producing a game maker. My group chose to make a RPG game maker. We divided the group into front end and backend, as well as data parsing and managing via the controller in between.

RPG refers to a role playing game, which involes a main character with characteristics such as health, items, moves/attacks. The player has a mission to achieve and does this by going on quests, meeting other characters, and going to different places. The challenge of making a RPG game maker is that it has to be design it in a way that the user is able to create a game different (and perhaps custom made) characters, maps, items etc with different characteristics, and then subsequently be able to play it. The project focused heavily on using object oriented models to represent the game.

The project was extremely intensive and heavy. Making a game maker is no easy task, as features are constantly being added to the game that might be useful to a user. Therefore, the platform and code has to remain extensible, closely following OO design principles. Other challenges include working in a large group, compartmentalizing different areas of the project, version control, sticking to agreed conventions to make working together seamless, as well as producing readable code. 

Below shows some screenshots of the user interface.
