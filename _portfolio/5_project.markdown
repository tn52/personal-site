Simility is an early stage startup specializing in fraud detection and analytics. I have been working as a software engineering intern for about four months now. 

<br/>

My main roles were to automate end-to-end quality assurance testing on the user interface front end, as well as to add new UI features. I managed to successfully automate the QA scripts, cutting down testing time significantly, and also managed to create an extendable, easy to use interface for adding tests. I also learnt much about full stack development by working with ReactJS on the front end. No pictures to show here, unfortunately.
