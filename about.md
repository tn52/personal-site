Hello! My name is Tze Kang, but also known as TK. I am an aspiring (enter something along the lines of software engineer/data scientist/product manager here) passionate about technology and the positive impact that it can bring to peoples' lives. 

Having been a <a href="https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/singapore-long-course-nationals-four-singapore-records-fall-three-by-joseph-schooling/" target="blank">competitive athlete</a> for almost 20 years, I am also interested in the area of fitness, health and wellness, and believe that a healthy body and mind are especially important in living a happy and fulfilling life. 

My dream is to one day <a href="http://medicalfuturist.com/20-potential-technological-advances-in-the-future-of-medicine-part-i/" target="blank">combine</a> these two areas of my life to do incredible things that would impact people's lives for the better.
